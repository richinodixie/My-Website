    <title>Behavioral Techniques</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>I think of behavioral techniques as having two parts. Coping skills, which help me handle stress after an event,
        and pre-emptive skills - mainly meditation - that help me prepare for dealing with stressful events as they
        happen.</h1>
    <h2>Reactive Techniques</h2>

            <p>The Guess What I Need And Ask For It way of communication is an excellent defense against passive
                aggressiveness. The "Guess What I Need" part prevents stonewalling; the more important part is the "Ask
                For It" part, because by directly stating your need, we avoid things like rhetorical questions, and we
                also avoid the cognitive distortion of <i>Mind Reading</i>, where we assume that people will figure out
                what we need even if we don't tell them.</p>
            <p>A key part of this technique is trusting your instincts. A lot of the time, emotional people don't want
                to tell you what they are upset about; it is also possible that they are not sure themselves. Instincts
                often are quite accurate in estimating the cause of their concern; even if you got it wrong, simply
                stating your best guess shows the other person that you care, and gives them the opportunity to correct
                you and thus revealing more about the reason that they are upset.</p>

            <li>Say and do what comes to mind</li>
            <p>Overcontrolled people have the tendency to think extensively about what they say and do, before they say
                and do it. It's related to the cognitive distortion of catastrophizing, in that we internally prepare
                for the worst outcome for our speech and actions.</p>
            <p>However, this has the downside of us often not saying and doing anything at all, or being really hesitant
                when telling a story or deciding on what to do. It is therefore important to realize that what you are
                going to say will not be as bad as you think, and that you're capable of holding wonderful conversations
                and doing exciting things.</p>
        </ol>

        <li>Fake it till you make it</li>
        <p>I used to really detest this. I value genuineness <em>a lot</em>, and it didn't make sense for me to be
            something I'm not. But now I realize that to act negatively when you feel negative only serves to keep you
            in the spiral. So it's critical to act positively - and this includes not only presenting a happy face, but
            also being professional, punctual, caring, and whatever the situation calls for. Most of the time, one has a
            good sense of equilibrium even when they are upset. Be that solid object for yourself.</p>

        <li>You're a Million Bucks!</li>
        <p>This goes along with the previous point of faking it till you make it. However you may feel about dressing
            up, getting a professional haircut, or investing in some nice pair of shoes, these things do make you feel
            better, and that's the whole point. So head over to Ross to pick up some brand clothing, go get their
            haircut, and walk with your head up high.</p>
