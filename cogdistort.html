    <title>Cognitive Distortions</title>

    <h1>
        Cognitive Distortions are bad! They distort reality and keep you in a world that is detrimental to your mental
        health.
    </h1>
    <ol>
        <li>All-or-nothing Thinking</li>
        <p>This mode of thinking believes everything is black-and-white.</p>
        <p>Example: You're either loved by everyone or no one. Your career is either entirely fulfilling or an absolute
            waste of time.</p>
        <p>A better way: realizing that it's not going to be on the ends of a spectrum, but rather in the middle.</p>

        <li>Catastrophizing</li>
        <p>This distortion takes one incident and believes in the worst outcome possible.</p>
        <p>Example: an argument that seems fiery at the moment is believed to be the end of a relationship. The mind
            wanders to division of property and looking for a new place to live.</p>
        <p>A better way: realizing that though your mind is trying to protect you by preparing for the worst, it
            goes too far and is now actually making you anxious about things that are not going to happen.</p>

        <li>Personalization</li>
        <p>This distortion believes 1. that things are targeting me, and/or 2. I'm responsible for everything.</p>
        <p>Example: 1. That group of boys at the gym are talking shit about me and think I'm weak; 2. I'm responsible
            for the emotional well-being of my patients and their failures reflect poorly on me and me alone.</p>
        <p>A better way: realizing that you care about yourself more than anyone else, and this distortion is merely
            a projection of what your insecurities rather than the reality.</p>

        <li>Disqualifying the Positive</li>
        <p>This distortion gives too much weight to the negative events and too little weight to the positive ones.</p>
        <p>Example: your colleague's high compliment registers very little, while a small mistake at work stays with you
            for several days</p>
        <p>A better way: for each negative thought, think of three positive and equally important thoughts. Moreover,
            hold onto the positive thoughts longer, even if it feels unnatural.</p>

        <li>Tunnel Vision</li>
        <p>This distortion makes you focus on one negative event and ignore the bigger picture.</p>
        <p>Example: people with eating disorders often focus too much on their weight and ignore their overall physical
            and mental health.</p>
        <p>A better way: understand that a hyperfocus on one particular thing and its negative aspects, no matter how
            accurate the aspects seem, already distorts the reality because it assigns disproportionate weights to
            components in the bigger picture.</p>
