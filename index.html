    <h1>Welcome to Richard's Website</h1>
    <h2>It's about CBT techniques that have helped me in life.</h2>
    <p>It's very important to recognize that documenting like this is only ever useful in teaching. It does not help me
        learn. The only learning takes place in the moment, when you're making decisions.</p>
    <p>In the end, I think positivity is the most important thing, and all we must do is to escape the spiraling trap of
        negativity and do whatever we can to feel positive again. This website is dedicated to this purpose.</p>
